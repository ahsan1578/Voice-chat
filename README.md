# Voice chat

---

This chat application was created using google's text-to-speech API.  
It converts the text message to voice messages before sending.  
Right now, only one voice is available. Future versions will have multiple voice and languages to choose from.

You need to have gcloud set up in your computer to run the application.  
You also must have a google cloud service account with text-to-speech API enabled

Use `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies
